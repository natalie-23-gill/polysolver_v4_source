//
// Breakpoints refer to both insertions and deletions which exceed
// the method's max_indel_size In this case we try to account for the
// breakpoint during snp-calling, but do not attempt to call the indel
// using the same methods used for small indels.
//
// Positions: Internally all positions are stored using zero-indexed
// position numbers.  For small indels and left breakpoints, we store
// the position of the first affected position. For right breakpoints,
// we store the first positions *after* the last affected
// position. Positions are stored in this manner so that the indels
// follow the starling range convention
//
// Large indel breakpoints are expected to be rare and to possibly
// have an unknown size (especially for insertions). Thus the indel
// length is not used in this case. To accommodate multiple different
// lengths at a single location, an advisory length may be inserted
// but it will not be used as part of any alignment calculation. For a
// breakpoint corresponding to a large deletion, "seq" is expected to
// represent the sequence on the other side of the breakpoint,
// starling will not look it up. In this way the break-point for *any*
// type of large-scale event can be accommodated for snp-calling. The
// seq convention for a breakpoint is to set the seq size equal to
// MAX_INDEL_SIZE
//
// Skips (introns) are *not* added here. They are treated as invariant
// alignment elements in the original read.
//
// The Swap type is initially used to represent combined
// insertion/deletion events, but will be used in the future for
// general alternate haplotypes.
//
// The "NONE" type is used for some indel lookup methods, because it sorts
// ahead of all other types at a given position:
//
namespace INDEL {
enum index_t {
    NONE,
    INSERT,
    DELETE,
    BP_LEFT,
    BP_RIGHT,
    SWAP
