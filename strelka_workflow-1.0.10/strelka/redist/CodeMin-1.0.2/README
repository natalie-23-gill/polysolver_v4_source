------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CodeMin minimization library provides a set of lightweight
minimization functions originally developed for the CodeAxe
phylogenetic analysis package. This distribution contains source code
for the library and several example programs.

Installation:

The CodeMin library itself is a set of C++ header files, so no build
or installation is required to use it. To ease portability,
CODEMIN_USE_BOOST may be defined to switch to the Boost versions of 
copysign, isinf and isnan when boost is available. 

Usage:

Three minimization functions are provided:

1) One-dimensional minimization using Brent's parabolic interpolation
method. Function call documented in include/minimize_1d.h

2) Multi-dimensional minimization using the Polak-Ribiere conjugate
gradient method. Function call documented in
include/minimize_conj_gradient.h

3) Multi-dimensional minimization using Powell's conjugate direction
set method. Function call documented in
include/minimize_conj_direction.h

Source code demonstrating an example usage of each function is
provided in the examples directory. On most *nix systems, typing
'make' in this directory will build the example programs. These
programs each optimize a small example function using one of the
minimizers.

The CodeMin source code is distributed under the MIT license, as
described in the COPYING file.
