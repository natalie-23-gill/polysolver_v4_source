Starling/Strelka variant callers -- ${VERSION}
---------------

Chris Saunders (csaunders@illumina.com)

Starling is a diploid small-variant caller for individual samples. This is also known as the Isaac Variant Caller.

Strelka is a somatic small-variant caller for matched tumor-normal samples.


Note that both of these variant callers are designed to be used within a parent workflow method -- Isaac Variant Caller workflow and Strelka workflow, respectively. See the correspondig workflow for extended installation, usage and output documentation.



INSTALLATION:

This code is designed to compile and run on *nux-like platforms.

For Centos/Amazon Linux and other rpm-based distributions, the following
packages (and their dependencies) are known requirements on top of
the base Amazon Linux AMI 2011.09:

* make
* gcc
* gcc-c++
* zlib
* zlib-devel


For Ubuntu and other Debian package distributions, the following
packages (and their dependencies) are known requirements on top of
the base Ubuntu 11.10 distribution:

* g++
* zlib1g-dev


Other compilation and runtime prerequisites are included in the distribution
tarball. These included prerequisites are:

* boost 1.44 (modified to include only the subset of the library used by Starling/Strelka)
* samtools 0.1.18 (modified to remove the 'curses' library requirement)
* codemin 1.0.2
* tabix 0.2.5 (makefile modified to reorder libz library to last place, as required for Ubuntu 12 build)
